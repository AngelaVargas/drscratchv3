drScratch
=========

drScratch is an analytical tool that evaluates your Scratch projects in a variety of computational areas to provide feedback on aspects such as abstraction, logical thinking, synchronization, parallelization, flow control, user interactivity and data representation. This analyzer is a helpful tool to evaluate your own projects, or those of your Scratch students.
